/*** PART 1: Hashing ***/

/* Birthday Attack 1
 *
 * 10 Points
 *
 * In this problem, you will implement a birthday attack on a simple hash function that is provided
 * in the header file. The goal will be to find a collision in the hash function using the Birthday 
 * Attack (with at least a 50% chance of success).
 *
 * Assumptions
 * - The hash function will have a 16 bit output (2 bytes). We will use the `unsigned short` type
 *   as the output type to make things simple.
 * - The hash function will take `unsigned integers` as input, again to make things simple.
 * - Your function will output:
 *     (a) two inputs a and b such that h(a) = h(b) (a collision), as a list [a, b], or 
 *     (b) {} if no collision is found.
 *   The output type of the function will be `vector<unsigned int>`.
 *
 * Algorithm Description
 * - Do the following a small constant number of times (at least 2):
 *     - Randomly generate 350 unsigned integers. Feel free to use the provided helper function
 *       `sample_int()`.
 *     - For each of the generated integers:
 *         - Hash the integer
 *         - Check if you find a collision. If yes, you can stop and output the two colliding inputs.
 * - If no collision is found, output {} (an empty list).
 *
 * Hash Function Signature
 *   unsigned short test_hash(unsigned int input);
 *
 */

unsigned int sample_int() {
    std::srand(std::time({})); 
    return static_cast<unsigned int>(rand());
}

unsigned short test_hash(unsigned int input) {
    const unsigned int a = 3177205741;
    const unsigned int b = 2371597069;
    return static_cast<unsigned short>(a*input + b);
}

vector<unsigned int> birthday_attack_1(function<unsigned short(unsigned int)> hash_function) {
    // Here, hash_function is an actual function. To test this function with
    // the provided `test_hash`, you can call your function in main as:
    //     vector<long> out = birthday_attack_1(test_hash);
    // Note you can implement your own test hash functions so long as their 
    // signatures match the `test_hash` function signature.

/* Birthday Attack 2
 *
 * 5 Points
 *
 * In this problem, you will implement a slightly different birthday attack on a simple 
 * hash function that is provided in the header file. The birthday attack described in 
 * part 1 above has the drawback of potentially needing too much space to implement
 * (proportional to sqrt(hash_output_domain_size)). You will address this in this
 * problem.
 *
 * The birthday-type attack you will implement in this problem is known as "Floyd's
 * tortoise and hare algorithm" (which is actually just a cycle finding algorithm).
 * We'll use it to implement a small-space birthday attack.
 *
 * Assumptions
 * - The hash function will have a 16 bit output (2 bytes). We will use the `unsigned short` type
 *   as the output type to make things simple.
 * - The hash function will take `unsigned integers` as input, again to make things simple.
 * - Your function will output two inputs a and b such that h(a) = h(b) (a collision), as a list [a, b].
 *   The output type of the function will be `vector<unsigned int>` to ensure that you can output -1 and
 *   to ensure there is no loss from converting a,b to a signed data-type.
 *
 * Algorithm Description
 * - Maintain two values, `tort` and `hare`, initialized as 
 *   tort = hash(0) and hare = hash(hash(0)).
 * - While tort != hare, take "one-step" with tort and "two-steps" with hare.
 *   This means updating tort by hashing the previous value of tort once, and hare
 *   by computing the double hash of the previous value of hare (see the initialization
 *   as an example).
 * - Once tort == hare, reset tort = 0.
 * - Now, while hash(tort) != hash(hare) take "one-step" with
 *   both tort and hare, until hash(tort) == hash(hare).
 * - Output [tort, hare]
 *
 * Additional Resources
 * - The following lecture notes explain both birthday attack algorithms:
 *      https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~davidcash/284-autumn-21/12-hash.pdf
 *
 * Hash Function Signature
 *   unsigned short test_hash(unsigned int input);

/*** PART 2: Graphs ***/

/* Topological Sorting
 *
 * 5 Points
 *
 * In this problem, you are tasked with reading the description of a
 * directed graph as input, then outputting a valid topological
 * sort of the graph, if one exists.
 *
 * Input
 *  - int n: number of nodes/vertices in the graph, labeled from 0 to n-1
 *  - vector<Edge> edges: a list of directed edges in the graph
 *
 * Output
 *  - vector<int>: a valid topological sorting of the graph. If
 *    no topological sorting exists, output an empty list.
 *    If multiple topological sortings exist, you only need to
 *    output a single one.
 *
 * Note: Edge is a struct defined in Firstname_Lastname_project2.h.

/* Single Source Shortest Paths on DAGs
 *
 * 10 points
 *
 * In this problem, you will be given a directed acyclic graph with 
 * arbitrary integer edge weights (i.e., they can be negative!), as
 * well as a single source node. Your goal will be to output the
 * shortest distance from the source to every other vertex in the
 * graph.
 *
 * Input
 *  - int n: number of nodes in the graph, labeled from 0 to n-1
 *  - vector<Edge> edges: list of weighted directed edges in the graph
 *  - int source: ID of the source node
 *
 * Output
 *  - vector<int>: vector of size n such that entry i is the distance
 *    from source to i in the given graph. Use the value "INT_MAX" to
 *    indicate that there is no path from source to i.
 *
 * Algorithm
 *  - Topological Sorting + BFS is enough to solve this problem.
 *
 * Assumptions
 *  - The graph given as input will always be a DAG

/* Dijkstra's Algorithm
 *
 * 20 Points
 *
 * In this problem, you are simply tasked to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm.
 *
 * Input
 *  - int n: number of nodes in the graph, labeled from 0 to n-1
 *  - vector<Edge> edges: list of weighted directed edges in the graph
 *  - int source: ID of the source node
 *
 * Output
 *  - vector<Node>: a list of size n such that entry i contains a Node node
 *    with the following properties:
 *      - node.id = i
 *      - node.path_cost = cost of the shortest path from source to i
 *      - node.pred = id of the predecessor of i on the shortest path from
 *        source to i
 *
 * Assumptions
 *  - You are guaranteed that the graph contains only non-negative edges
 *    (i.e., weight at least 0). For simplicity, all weights will be
 *    integers.
 * 
 * Note: Node is a struct defined in Firstname_Lastname_project2.h.

vector<Node> dijkstras_algorithm(int n, vector<Edge> edges, int source) {
    // Your code here!
    // Note: see the LeetCode from in-class for the problem "Cheapest Flights
    // K stops" to see how you can create a priority_queue with the Node struct.
}


/* A-star Algorithm
 *
 * 25 Points
 *
 * In this problem, you are asked to implement a modified version of Dijkstras,
 * known as A* (A-star). The A* algorithm is very similar to Dijkstras, with
 * two notable differences:
 *  (a) A* uses some heuristic function h to estimate the distance between any
 *      two nodes; and
 *  (b) A* only finds a path from a specified source node and a target node.
 *
 * Recall in Dijkstras, the algorithm finds the shortest path from a single
 * source to all other nodes in the graph.
 *
 * Given a source s and a target t, A* is guaranteed to output a shortest path
 * from s to t as long as the heuristic h underestimates the distance between 
 * any two nodes u,v in the graph. If d(u,v) represents the actual distance
 * between u and v, then h(u,v) <= d(u,v) for all u,v is enough to guarantee
 * that A* outputs a shortest path from s to t.
 *
 * For this specific version of A*, you will be given two points on a grid (a
 * start point and an end point). The grid will be specified by a graph, with
 * nodes being a GridNode (each with their own x and y value on the grid), and
 * edges being a GridEdge. Each GridEdge has a weight that is of a double type.
 * A GridEdge will only connect adjacent or diagonal nodes. Formally, for a
 * GridNode at point (x,y), all of the following edges are possible:
 *
 *  - (x+1, y) (cost = 1.0)
 *  - (x-1, y) (cost = 1.0)
 *  - (x, y+1) (cost = 1.0)
 *  - (x, y-1) (cost = 1.0)
 *  - (x+1, y+1) (cost = 1.5)
 *  - (x-1, y+1) (cost = 1.5)
 *  - (x+1, y-1) (cost = 1.5)
 *  - (x-1, y-1) (cost = 1.5)
 * 
 * Here, edges all have an implicit movement cost, described above. Moving along
 * a diagonal edge has a cost of 1.5, while moving along a cardinally adjacent  
 * edge (north, south, east, west) has a cost of 1.
 *
 * Note that GridEdge and GridNode are structs defined in Firstname_Lastname_project2.h.
 *
 * Input:
 *  - int m: number of columns (x-axis)
 *  - int n: number of rows in the grid (y-axis)
 *  - vector<GridEdge> edges: list of edges in the graph
 *  - GridNode source: source node of the algorithm
 *  - GridNode target: target node of the algorithm
 *  - function<double(GridNode, GridNode)> h: h is a function which takes as input
 *      two GridNodes and outputs a double. This represents the heruistic_cost
 *      function for A*.
 *
 * Output:
 *  - vector<GridNode>: a list of nodes containing the path from source to target.
 *                      Note that if variable "output" is your output vector, then
 *                      it must satisfy the following properties:
 *                          - if a path from source to target exists, then
 *                              - output[0] = source
 *                              - output[output.size()-1] = target
 *                              - Moreover, output[output.size()-1].path_cost is the cost
 *                                of the path from source to target.
 *                          - if no path from source to target exists, then
 *                              - output = {} (the empty list)
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  The algorithm is nearly identical to Dijkstra's Algorithm, with the following changes.
 *      - Suppose in Dijkstra's you are currently considering node u and expanding the 
 *        frontier along the neighbors of u.
 *      - Let v be a neighbor of u.
 *      - In Dijkstra's, you check if u.cost + weight(u,v) < v.cost, where weight(u,v) 
 *        is the weight of the edge from u to v. If this is true, you update v.cost as
 *        v.cost = u.cost + weight(u,v), update it in / add it to the priority queue,
 *        and continue.
 *      - In A*, this is modified as: v.cost = u.cost + weight(u,v) + heuristic_cost(v, target),
 *        where heuristic_cost(v, target) is a heuristic distance from node v to the target node
 *        target.
 *  
 *  As part of your implementation of A*, you are required to implement the function
 *  heuristic_cost(GridNode start, GridNode dest) defined below. Your heuristic should never
 *  over estimate the distance between any two nodes start and dest. Remember, in theory you
 *  can move north, south, east, west, or along any diagonal (so long as there is an edge).
 *  Use this information to write a heuristic function that never over estimates the distance.
