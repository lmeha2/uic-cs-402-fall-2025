# UIC CS 402 Fall 2025

## Project 2: Hashing and Graphs
In this project, you will have practice with both Hashing and Graph algorithms.
The implementations will be built off of concepts we have done in class up to this point.

**Please carefully read the algorithm descriptions in `Firstname_Lastname_project2.cpp`. You will need to implement the specified algorithms.**
The project includes
- `Firstname_Lastname_project2.cpp`
    - Your main file where you will implement most of your source code.
    It also contains the algorithm descriptions you will need to implement, so please read it carefully.

- `Firstname_Lastname_project2.h`
    - Header file with various function signatures.
    You can add things to the header/`.cpp` file as you need.

Other notes
- Please ask questions about the project on Piazza.
Many students on Project 1 had similar questions, but nobody asked!

### Due Date
**Thursday, November 13, 2025 by 11:59pm**


### Writing Your Code
This project is distributed through GitHub and you will write your code using git for version control. My advice to you is to commit early and commit often to your repository to accurately track your progress when writing your project solutions.

The included files in this project all have additional instructions in the code comments; please read them carefully! The comments also include the point breakdowns for each of the functions you will be implementing.


#### Group Work
You may work in groups of up to 3 people.
However, every student is expected to **individually submit code**.

### Testing Your Code
I encourage you to write small test cases for yourself for this project.
About halfway through the project cycle, I will add some files to help you test your code.
My goal will be to also include an autograding resource with these testing files so you can test your code via the autograder as well.

### Submission
As with Project 1, your submission will be via a GitHub repository.

### Grading
The project is worth 75 points for all students.

#### Autograder
I will again use an autograder for this assignment. My goal is to also provide you with the autograder so you can run it as well. Stay tuned for this!

#### Manual Inspection
Part of your grade will also come from manual inspection of your code. This is because the auto grader cannot check if you are implementing the correct algorithms, it can only check that you pass some tests. To help make this process smooth and easy, please be sure to write legible and clear code.

#### Code Presentation

Each student is required to give a "code presentation" after submission of their project. You will schedule a one-on-one meeting with me (at most 30min) where we will discuss your code and I will ask you questions about your code. This is to ensure you actually understand the code you are submitting and not just pulling from sources online without understanding what is happening.

**Important**: this code presentation is individual; i.e., even if you are working in a group, you will have to present to me as an individual. This is again to make sure you actually understand what is happening in your code.

#### Extra Credit
I will also be implementing all the functions for this project. For a bit of fun, bragging rights, and extra credit, I will run each student's code against my own code and see which one performs better. Each function you implement that can beat my code will earn you 1 point of extra credit on the project (max of 6 points for this project).
